Take my hand it's time to leave
From now on to eternity
How we all know it gets hard to breathe
And how we got here is a mystery

So we leave the world we know behind
Behind
There's so much there to see

I hope you'll find what you're looking for
Ha-aah-ah

Follow me like seek the light
For this darkness, we burn so bright
How we lose our way, we get lost sometimes
Maybe a little bit but we made it out
