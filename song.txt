Take my hand it's time to leave
From now on to eternity
How we all know it gets hard to breathe
And how we got here is a mystery

So we leave the world we know behind
Behind
There's so much there to see

I hope you'll find what you're looking for
Ha-aah-ah

Follow me like seek the light
For this darkness, we burn so bright
How we lose our way, we get lost sometimes
Maybe a little bit but we made it out

So we leave the world we know behind
Behind
There's so much there to see (yeah-eh-eh)

Aah-aah-aah
I hope you'll find what you're looking for (aah-aah-aah)
Hu-hu-uu
Aah-aah-aah
I hope you'll find what you're looking for (aah-aah-aah)
Ha-aah
Hu-uu-hu

I just want you to know
I just want you to know
That you are not alone
That you are not alone
